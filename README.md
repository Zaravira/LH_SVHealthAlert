# LH_SVHealthAlert

Very simple little mod that will alert you if your shield or hull drops below 50%.
If you're like me and often get into big fights and having to carefully stare at your health bar, you'll like this one.

No more need to watch your health, instead you can focus on those pesky healers or simply sit back and enjoy the chaos without running the risk of missing a sudden baddy shredding you to bits. 
When your health starts to drop, it'll alert you and pull your attention back so you can intervene well before you die.

# Installing
Simply grab the .dll from the release and stick it into steam\steamapps\common\Star Valor\BepInEx\plugins folder. You'll have to install BepInEx first if you haven't already though.
